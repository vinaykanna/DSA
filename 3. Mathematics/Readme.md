## The Modulo Operator

In computing, the modulo operation returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another (called modulus of the operation).

For example, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1, because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0, because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3

When exactly one of *a* or *n* is negative, the naïve definition breaks down, and programming languages differ in how these values are defined

Although typically performed with *a* and *n* both being integers, many computing systems now allow other types of numeric operands. The range of values for an integer modulo operation of *n*
is 0 to *n* − 1 inclusive (*a* mod 1 is always 0; *a* mod 0 is undefined, possibly resulting in a division by zero error in some programming languages).

Given two positive numbers a and n, a % n - if a is less than n the result would be n.

Ex: **6 % 3 = 0**

Ex: **7 % 2 = 1**

Ex: **253 % 10 = 3**

Ex: **2 % 3 = 3**

## L****ogarithm****

**logarithm**, the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number. Expressed mathematically, *x* is the logarithm of *n* to the base *b* if *bx* = *n*, in which case one writes *x* = log*b* *n*.

For example, 23 = 8; therefore, 3 is the logarithm of 8 to base 2, or 3 = log2 8. In the same fashion, since 102 = 100, then 2 = log10 100. Logarithms of the latter sort (that is, logarithms with base 10) are called common, or Briggsian, logarithms and are written simply log *n*.
